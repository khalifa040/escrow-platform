# Escrow Platform

An escrow platform is a secure and trustless system that holds and regulates the exchange of  tokens, or between two or more parties. The platform ensures that the tokens are only released when predetermined conditions are met (seller received traditional currency), providing a safe and reliable way to facilitate transactions.

## Key Features

- *Secure Holding*: The platform securely holds the tokens in escrow until the seller received the specified amount of traditional currency from the buyer.
- *Conditional Release*: tokens are only released when the buyer sent the traditional currency and inform.
- *Trustless*: The platform operates without the need for trusted intermediaries.
- *Secure and Transparent*: The platform ensures a secure and transparent transaction process.

## Benefits

- *Security*: Ensures the safe exchange of valuable items.
- *Trust*: Eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries.
- *Efficiency*: Streamlines the transaction process.
- *Transparency*: Provides a clear and transparent transaction record.

Now that we've covered the key aspects of the escrow platform, it's time to write the code that will make it work. Below is the implementation in PHP programming language and JavaScript.
